# Steps to Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot

1. **Define Project Structure**
   -  Create a new Django app (e.g., `chatbot`) alongside your `documents` app.  
   -  Install necessary packages: `transformers`, `faiss-cpu` (or `faiss-gpu`), `sentence-transformers`, and `openai` (if using OpenAI API).

2. **Ingest and Index Documents**
   -  Load your document files (PDFs, text, etc.) from the `documents` app’s storage.  
   -  Preprocess text: split into passages (e.g., 200–500 tokens), clean whitespace.  
   -  Compute embeddings for each passage using a Sentence Transformer model (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).  
   -  Build a vector store (FAISS index) mapping passage embeddings to document metadata.

3. **Set Up Retrieval Layer**
   -  Create a retrieval function that:
     - Embeds the user query with the same encoder.  
     - Searches the FAISS index to return top-k relevant passages.  
     - Aggregates passages and their metadata for context.

4. **Integrate Generation Model**
   -  Choose a generation model (e.g., OpenAI GPT-3.5, GPT-4, or a local LLM).  
   -  Construct a prompt template that injects retrieved passages as context before the user’s query.  
   -  Call the generation API or local LLM with the assembled prompt to produce the answer.

5. **Design Chat Interface**
   -  In Django, add API endpoints in the `chatbot` app (using DRF) to accept user messages and return responses.  
   -  Build a frontend chat widget (using Django templates + JavaScript or a React/Vue component) that:
     - Sends user input to the retrieval + generation endpoint.  
     - Displays streamed or full responses in the chat window.  
     - Maintains conversation history for context continuity.

6. **Manage Conversation Context (Optional)**
   -  Store recent user messages and model responses in session or a lightweight database.  
   -  On each turn, include the last n messages in the prompt to the generation model for coherence.

7. **Deployment Considerations**
   -  Persist the FAISS index to disk and load it at startup to avoid re-indexing on each run.  
   -  Cache embeddings for repeated queries.  
   -  Secure API keys and configure rate-limits if using a hosted LLM.  
   -  Monitor performance and latency; consider batching embedding calls.

8. **Testing & Evaluation**
   -  Write unit tests for retrieval accuracy (e.g., check that top passages are relevant).  
   -  Evaluate generation quality with sample queries.  
   -  Iterate on passage size, prompt formatting, and model temperature for best results.

These steps provide a concise roadmap to build a RAG-powered chatbot in your Django project.
